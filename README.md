## Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game**! This Java program is a simple console-based game where you try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within a set number of attempts. The game keeps track of the number of rounds won, lost, and total rounds played, providing feedback and handling invalid inputs gracefully.

## Grade Calculator Java Program

The **GradeCalc** Java program calculates the average marks for six subjects and determines the grade based on the average percentage. The program ensures that the input values are valid numeric values within the range of 0 to 100 and formats the average percentage to 2 decimal places. It provides a clear and accurate representation of the grade based on the calculated average.

## ATM Interface

This project simulates a basic ATM interface using Java. It allows users to check their balance, deposit money, and withdraw funds from their bank account. The program includes error handling for invalid inputs and maintains the balance of the user's account, ensuring smooth and reliable transactions.
